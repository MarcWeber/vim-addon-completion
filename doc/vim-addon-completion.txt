Purpose
=======
completion helpers:

(1) vim_addon_completion#AdvancedCamelCaseMatching(expr):
 implements camel case matching

(2) vim_addon_completion#CompleteUsing(func_name):
  allows completion using custom function preserving completion func setting
  
  Example usage: 
    inoremap <buffer> <expr> <c-x><c-w> vim_addon_completion#CompleteUsing('vim_addon_completion#CompleteWordsInBuffer')


historical notes:
===================
All the old code keeping multiple completion functions as alternative was
removed because it was too hard to remember which completion func was set in a buffer.
The only sane way is ask users to define their own mappings as shown above at <c-x><c-w>.

How to provide customizable matches to users
============================================

AdditionalCompletionMatchPatterns returns a regex matching CamelCase patterns.
See comment above the function.
A user can override the default behaviour.

Example usage:

fun Compl(first, base)
  if ..
  else
    let patterns = vim_addon_completion#AdditionalCompletionMatchPatterns(a:base
        \ , "your_completion_func_name", {'match_beginning_of_string': 1})
    let additional_regex = get(patterns, 'vim_regex', "")
    
    list names = ["name","another_name"]

    for n in names
      if n =~ '^'.a:base || (additional_regex != "" && a:base =~ additional_regex)
        call complete_add({'word': n, ....})
      endif
    endfor
    return []
  endif
endfun
